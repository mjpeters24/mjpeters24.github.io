  <h2>Best Sources To Get Started With Learning Music Theory</h2>
  <h4>Like many people I really struggled getting started with learning Music Theory, so here's some help!</h4>

        <a href="https://www.marinmusic.com/store"><h4>Marin Music Center With Stuart </h4></a>
            <p>Personally this one is my favorite as Uncle Stuart is just a really funny and relatable guy. He's also a really good teacher and keeps you interested at all times.</p>
            <p>To help out even more, he runs a <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/@marinmusic">youtube channel</a> that's dedicated to teaching music theory and guitar.</p>
