            <h2>The request to tell what I’ve achieved in life has actually struck me with existential dread</h2>
            <p>I’m going to be completely honest; I have achieved nothing in my life (at least nothing that I'm very proud of). And unironically, it took a computer science class to tell me that. But, ever since my brain decided to start working (about 2 years ago), I have been working on some things.</p>
            <p>Of these things, I’ve been attempting to learn music theory through guitar (originally tried keyboard and bass but didn’t enjoy it)</p>

            <p><em>Above is a picture of my guitar, I guess its relevant to the subject.</em></p>
            <p>But more on the subject of music theory, I’ve been using somebody’s channel on YouTube called <a href="httpshttps://www.youtube.com/@marinmusic" ><strong>Marin Music Center</strong></a> to learn it. He's been really useful in learning it while also making it interesting</p>
