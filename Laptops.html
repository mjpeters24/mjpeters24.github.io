  <h2>My Favorite (and Unfavorite) Laptops So Far</h2>
  
  <h4>I've had a couple laptops throughout the years, either hand me downs or one's I bought on my own. Here's some help on deciding which you might want!</h4>

      <ul>
        <li><h3>Lenovo Yoga C940</h5></li>

          <p>Personally this one is my favorite as it's just been a super dependable, lightweight, decently powerful, cheap laptop. I got it used for dirt cheap and it's 16GB of ram and hefty processor have been carrying me through college with ease. It's been easy to repair so far as I did by it used.</p>
        
        <li><h3>Asus VivoBook Flip 12</h5></li>

          <p>I hate this one. Even though it was free, it just sucked. Slow, bad battery life, and a touchscreen that barely worked. Dont touch it.</p>
        
        <li><h3>HP Victus 15</h5></li>
        <img src="Pictures/victus_2.jpg" alt="HP Victus 15 Laptop" width="360" height=auto>
          <p>Nothing really bad to say about this one. It's meant to be some fancy gaming laptop but I just used it for 3D modeling as the Lenovo wasn't strong enough. Pretty solid laptop, just kinda heavy, large, and to "techy" looking.</p>
