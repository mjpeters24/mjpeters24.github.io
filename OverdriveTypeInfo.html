  <h2>Difference's In Overdrive, What are They?</h2>

  What is Overdrive?
</H4>
    <p>
        Overdrive is a guitar effect that simulates a tube amp 
        being pushed so it breaks up a little—more grit, sustain, 
        and bite without full-on distortion. With pedals, you mostly 
        see two flavors: Non-transparent overdrive,
        which boosts the mids and tightens the low end so you cut 
        through a mix; And transparent overdrive, 
        which keeps your guitar and amp’s natural tone but just 
        adds breakup and a bit of push. Both do “drive,” they 
        just affect your sound differently.

  What are the differences?
</H4>
    <p>
        Transparent overdrive aims to keep your guitar and amp’s 
        natural voice intact that being, flat(ish) EQ, lighter 
        compression, and touch-sensitive breakup that mostly adds 
        level and soft clipping. Non-transparent overdrive imposes 
        its own tone: a shaped EQ (often a mid hump or some bass 
        roll-off), more compression, and a distinct clipping 
        character that tightens lows and helps you cut through 
        a mix. In short, transparent = preserves; non-transparent 
        = colors.
